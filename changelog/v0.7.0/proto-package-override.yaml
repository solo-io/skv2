changelog:
- type: NEW_FEATURE
  description: >
    When using proto-based types for the `Spec` and `Status` fields of a resource, we currently require that the
    messages for these types are defined in a proto package that matches the group name of the resource.
    This change adds a new `ProtoPackage` option that can be used to override the name of the proto packages we inspect
    when looking for the messages. If the options in unspecified, it defaults to the group name of the resource.
