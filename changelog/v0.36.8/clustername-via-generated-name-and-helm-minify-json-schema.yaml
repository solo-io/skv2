      description: >
        Updated the ClusterResourceId interface to exclusively use the metadata.generatedName field for storing 
        cluster names, completely eliminating access to the annotations map which was causing race conditions.
        This avoids the race condition when multiple goroutines read/write to the annotations map concurrently.

      description: >
        With this change, the `values.schema.json` file generated as part of the Helm chart generation is no longer 
        prettified. This drastically reduces the size of the file and minimizes the changes of the new maximum file size 
        limit [introduced by Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/e4da49785aa6e6ee2b86efd5dd9e43400318262b) in `v3.17.3`.
        There are no functional changes. Human users can still prettify the file using external tools (e.g. `jq`) if necessary.
