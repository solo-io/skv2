      description: >
        Updated the ClusterResourceId interface to exclusively use the metadata.generatedName field for storing 
        cluster names, completely eliminating access to the annotations map which was causing race conditions.
        This avoids the race condition when multiple goroutines read/write to the annotations map concurrently.
