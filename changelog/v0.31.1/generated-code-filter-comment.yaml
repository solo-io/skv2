    description: >
      Generated Kubernetes resource code that includes filters now has an additional comment with how to use the filter.
      This is needed as our filter code is opposite of regular predicate-style filtering (e.g. if a filter returns true, it is
      excluded rather than included), to prevent confusion for developers.
