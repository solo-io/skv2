    Implement custom generation of Deepcopy methods for Kubernetes types. Current limitations in the generation of standard Deepcopy code in with kube-codegen prevent compatibility with types containing Protobuf Oneofs. This change implements a naive solution, generating proto.Clone-based deepcopy methods.

    The use of the deepcopy codegen package is currently deprecated and disabled by default. set your `codegen.Command`'s `Generators` to []GeneratorTypes{GeneratorType_Deepcopy} to preserve the original behavior.
