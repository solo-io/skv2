      Adds the ability to render deployments templates with a reference global floatingUserId field. This field is used to globally unset
      the runAsUser field in container securityContexts (like the painter's floatingUserId) and supresses the rendering of the
      pod's securityContext. This feature is enabled by setting the GlobalFloatingUserIdPath in the Operator to the path of the global field,
      and defaults to an empty string.
