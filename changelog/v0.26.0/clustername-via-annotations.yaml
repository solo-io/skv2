      description: >
        In the ClusterResourceId interface, ClusterName field is replaced with GetAnnotations method,
        since k8s v1.24+ removes the ClusterName field from resources.
        Now, a resource annotation of "cluster.solo.io/cluster" is expected to hold a string of the cluster name.
