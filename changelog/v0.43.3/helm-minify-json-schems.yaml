  description: >
    With this change, the `values.schema.json` file generated as part of the Helm chart generation is no longer 
    prettified. This drastically reduces the size of the file and minimizes the changes of the new maximum file size 
    limit [introduced by Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/e4da49785aa6e6ee2b86efd5dd9e43400318262b) in `v3.17.3`.
    There are no functional changes. Human users can still prettify the file using external tools (e.g. `jq`) if necessary.
