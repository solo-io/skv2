    description: >
      v2 sets have been refactored to use a slice as the backing data structure, allowing for faster GC time of entire sets,
      and more efficient iteration over the set. A few methods have been removed, namely `List` and `UnsortedList`, both which have been
      replaced with a more accurate name: "FilterOutAndCreateList". In addition, a `Filter` and `Iter` method have been added to v2 sets.
    skipCI: "false"
